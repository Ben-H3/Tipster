## Notes

This was my first time using Objective-C, so I was excited for the opportunity to experiment with this simple program as a way to learn the basics of Objective-C syntax. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge of coding as I continue building more Objective-C projects.

## Credits

All graphics and design were done by me personally for this project.
